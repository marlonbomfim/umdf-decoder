- Building the projects

All the projects depend on up-to-date (at least 1.4.7) Boost libraries,
specificially Boost.Thread, Boost.Filesystem, and Boost.System will have
to be installed.  If you have installed Boost to a fairly standard place
(/usr/local or something), find_package() should be able to find it, otherwise
you might need to do some extra cmake setup (see the CMake documentation on
find_package).

market_data-fast and bvmf_console both require the QuickFAST library to do the
actual FAST decoding.  Once you have this library installed, you'll need to
change the QuickFAST_PATH variable (see the appropriate CMakeLists.txt file)
to point to the correct path of the quickfast src folder.

- Things currently unimplemented

- Of the types of market data that can be sent, only Bids and Offers are
currently implemented
- Most of the extra data sent in a SecurityList message is ignored
- The FIX Replay stream connection is not implemented
- News and SecurityStatus messages are not implemented
